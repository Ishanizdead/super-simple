<p><b>Paragraph Writing:</b><font color="white"> Take a wild guess as to what you would say to describe a
     paragraph? Many students describe paragraphs as what consists of the story, or a set of sentences that
      are grouped together to form a paragraph, or a set of sentences that cover half a page of your story,
    and so on.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="red"></font><img src="G:\BGs\unnamed (3) (1).png" align="left" width="300">*Although these ideas may look true in many instances, they donâ€™t really define 
    the idea behind a paragraph. This is one of those subtle things in English writing that never really 
    gets explained on priority, making it one of those commonly used things that are barely understood. 
    Which is why this read is going to be great.</p>

<p>*So what goes into a Paragraph Writing? It all begins with one idea, and everything familiar that naturally
   flows with it fits into one paragraph. Every paragraph you have should have points or sentences related 
   and referring to the central idea. These ideas should not be random. It always helps to jot down quick
    points quickly on a rough sheet, arrange them into a logical chronological order that flows in one 
    direction, making it easier to read.</p>
<hr>
<p>Donâ€™t leave any point or sentence hanging loose without any substantiation or explanation. Every statement you make should be backed by logical reasoning that stays in one paragraph.</p>
